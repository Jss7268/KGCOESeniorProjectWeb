# EDCS Front-End

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.1.

## Before running
You need to copy the `app.settings.ts.example` file:
```
cp src/app/app.settings.ts.example src/app/app.settings.ts
```
__Don't edit the `app.settings.ts.example` file, instead, make changes to the `app.settings.ts` file__

If running in a deployed environment, change the `API_ENDPOINT` to point to the location that you are running the [backend](https://github.com/Jss7268/KGCOESeniorProjectAPI)
If running with ssl, you need to use https. (Not necessary to run locally)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
